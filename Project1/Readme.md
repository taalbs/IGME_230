# Project 1 - Website Game #

## I. High Concept ##

It's an avoidance game where random enviorment is generated and the user has to navigate through the space with the arrow keys.

## II. Genre ##

The genre this game would fall into would be **platform** and slightly **racing**.

## III. Platform ##

The platform for this game will start on desktop with the arrow keys being the primary method of moving. Eventually, once a touch screen is added in, it will be mobile supported using the touch screen as movement.

## IV. Story ##

The objective of this game is to make it to the end of the course without crashing into a wall. A potential change to the story would be the course might be infinite and scores based on distance travelled rather then time to complete.

## V. Esthetics ##
The graphic style for this game with be  cartoonish feel with very simple design. The sound with be some ambient techno with some sound notifcations for when you start, crash, or finish.

## VI. Gameplay ##

### Mechanics ###
The choices made by the player will only be able to move left and right or remain going straight. There will be a leaderboard implmented so players can track progress.

### Control ###
The controls will be slightly different for Desktop and Mobile support:
- Desktop will use the arrow keys or WASD
- Mobile can use the touch screen to turn left right
- Mobile might have accelerometer to turn. 

## VII. Screenshots ##
Here are a few mockup screen shots of what the game might potentially look like. 
**Still in progress.**

## VIII. Other ##
I like trains

## IX. About the Developer ##
My name is Ben Talbot, I am a 5th year Computer Engineering and Technology major at RIT. I have always enjoyed coding, so game design felt outside of my field, but I always enjoy a challenge. Unfortunately I don't have much experience drawing or designing, so the graphics will be slightly under-par. I hope I can carry any of my previous skills into this project.
